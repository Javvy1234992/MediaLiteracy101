       "Media Literacy 101 is the one stop site for cultivating and sharpening your media literacy skills! Media literacy, “the practice of taking in media messages and understanding their influence on your thoughts, feelings and behaviors” (
        Mark, 2025),  is non-negotiable for effective processing and transfer of information. Its importance is twice-over in this age where the democratisation and sheer speed of the circulation of information
         across various media platforms has created  a lax attitude towards media literacy- particularly in the Generation Z cohort, born more so out of ignorance and a limited digital literacy by the fact of this lack in MIL (afterall
         , dexterous navigation of technology for information is a base trait of digital literacy (UNESCO, 2022))." </p>

       "Its importance is twice-over in this age where the democratisation and sheer speed of the circulation of information
         across various media platforms has created  a lax attitude towards media literacy- particularly in the Generation Z cohort, born more so out of ignorance and a limited digital literacy by the fact of this lack in MIL (afterall
         , dexterous navigation of technology for information is a base trait of digital literacy (UNESCO, 2022)). As Coinpedia entrepreneur, Qadir AK astutely points out, Generation Z individuals have shown to be generally less digitally literate than their 
         Millennial counterparts because of the environment of their upbringing (K, 2023). Millennials, dubbed “digital immigrants" for the fact that they had to adjust to technology as opposed to Gen Z “digital natives” who were born into it, experienced a more “hands-on”, 
         discovery oriented relationship to technology and so messed around with app settings and things like coding. 
         Comparatively, Gen Z’ “experience is  more about optimization than overcoming hurdles” (K, 2023). A 2023 polling by the International research group YouGov, found that when presented with real and A.I 
         generated headlines, “11% of 18- to 29-year-olds earned a high score (over 16 headlines correct) and 36% received a low score (10 headlines or under correct)” (Kelly, 2024)
          while “Of those 65 and older, 36% earned a high score, while only 9% received a low score” (Kelly, 2024).
          Evidently, Gen Z’s lack of media literacy makes them much more susceptible to misinformation which inhibits their ability to draw credible conclusions from the world around them in the academic,
          political and personal spheres of life and limit their effectiveness as responsible members of society. 
      It’s not all bleak though, media literacy is a skill and like all skills can be developed and honed to one’s needs"
